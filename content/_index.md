Hi 👋 I am a final-year PhD student in Machine Learning at the [University of Cambridge](https://damtp.cam.ac.uk/) supervised by Prof. [Mihaela van der Schaar](https://www.vanderschaar-lab.com). My research interests span: **Data-Centric AI**, **Large Language Models (LLM)s**, **Responsible AI**, **Synthetic Data** and **Uncertainty Quantification**. 

Since data is the fuel for ML, my research aims to develop systematic data-centric approaches applicable to different data modalities (tabular, image & text) --- to make ML systems more reliable & trustworthy 🦾, whilst also improving model performance & training efficiency 🚀. Most recently on **LLMs**!

I hold a Masters degree from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) working on Bayesian Deep Learning, as well as a Masters from the [University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa)](https://www.wits.ac.za/) working on Signal Processing & ML for Parkinson's Disease. I also hold a dual-bachelors in Information Engineering & Biomedical Engineering from the [University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa)](https://www.wits.ac.za/). 

My industry experience includes time as an ML Researcher at [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.co.uk/) working on LLM verification, test-time scaling and uncertainty quantification. Before my PhD, I worked on production ML systems as a Data Scientist working on Computer Vision at [Shutterstock (USA)](https://www.shutterstock.com) and as an ML Engineer working on NLP at [Multichoice](https://www.multichoice.com/) (Africa's largest multimedia company).

<span style="color: red; font-size: 30px">**Note: I am finishing my PhD in the Summer of 2025 and am looking for full-time industry ML Research opportunities.**</span>

Please reach out if you think I am a good fit: ns741@cam.ac.uk
